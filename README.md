# Modelling the UST Yield curve using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This project illustrates how PCA can be used to better understand the underlying factors driving the changes in US Treasury yields movements. I run the PCA on multiple time intervals between July 2001 and December 2024 to show how different monetary policy regimes affect the principal components affecting the yield curve. 

I further focus on a principal factor affecting the curve slope, modeled on the timeframe after March 2022. The theoretical reasoning behind such a timeframe is the FED's tightening cycle which arguably affects not only the short rate, but also the market's reaction across the entire curve.
