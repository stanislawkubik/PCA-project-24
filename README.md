# Modelling the UST Yield curve using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
This project illustrates how PCA can be used to better understand the underlying factors driving the changes in US Treasury yields movements. I run the PCA on multiple time intervals between July 2001 and December 2024 to show how different monetary policy regimes affect the principal components affecting the yield curve. 

# Data
